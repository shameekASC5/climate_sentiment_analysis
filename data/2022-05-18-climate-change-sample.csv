The engineers battling to stop global warming ruining roads 
There are two recurring topics Maybe you will see it Climate Crisis and Pharmaceutically Injecting the People Over and Over and Over again One may even begin to ask what/who the climate crisis is ultimately being blamed on? 
"Resources for whom? Of course, we could ruin the earth for humans and die of self a imposed extinction. But the earth will recover. We couldn't kill it if we tried."

"While the lies and lack of diplomacy are important, this actually will support Morrison's attempts at signalling to his base through nationalist sentiment. It distracts from a much more serious issue of AUS undermining climate action and promoting CCS."
"RT It's a cold winter. There's a gas crisis. The case for nuclear in the EU has never been clearer, and this is without even considering climate pledges. Can we please get more media attention of this obvious fact and far less (i.e. zero) on the absurd anti fringe"

"RT Tipping points could create cascading events when global warming pushes temperatures above 1.5C/2.7F. IF we don't combat CLIMATE CHANGE, ICE SHEETS will tip first, then the ATLANTIC CURRENTS, followed by the AMAZON RAINFOREST. Leading to ACCELERATED CHANGE. #DemVoice1 "
And yet they scream climate change while mandating masks. We're ruining the planet courtesy of the screeching hypocrites.

"Pro-nuclear, the best energy source now to fight climate change, is not fossil fuel grifter."
"RT Is it morally possible to choose not to be an activist? I feel like right now we have no choice but to become activist ourselves and step up for real change, the climate and ecological breakdown is a problem we can no longer ignore"
